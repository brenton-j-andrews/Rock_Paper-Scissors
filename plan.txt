Step 1: create function computerPlay() which will return a randomly selected move.

Pseudocode:
1. Call function from the main script -> More on that later.
2. Inside the function, a constant array will contain the 3 possilbe outcomes: "Rock", "Paper" and "Scissors"
3. Using Math.Random() generate a random number between 0 and 2 and store to a variable.
4. Return the indexed array element at the location of the randomly generated number.
5. Save the returned string to variable computerMove.


Step 2: create function playRound(playerMove, computerMove) that determines the winner for a single round.

Pseudocode:
1. Call the function from the main script, the computerMove argument will be a call to the computerPlay function.
2. Check the two arguments for winning conditions.
3. If player wins, print out message and return "player" string to main script.
4. If computer wins, print out message and return "computer" string to main script.
5. If it is a tie, print out message and return nothing to main script.


Step 3: create a function game() that plays thru 5 rounds of R-P-S and keeps track of score and reports winner / loser at the end.

Pseudocode:
1. Initialize player_wins and computer_wins variables to track the total scores.
2. Commence a for-loop to execute 5 times.
3. Prompt the user for their move. Assign input to playerMove variable and convert to all lowercase.
4. Call the playRound function, passing in playerMove and a call to computerPlay() function as arguments. Assign the return value of playRound to outcome variable.
5. Examine outcome variable. true indicates player victory, false indicates computer victory, null value indicates tie.
6. Modify player_wins or computer_wins as per the value of outcome variable.
7. Re execute steps 3-6 until the conditions to break the for loop are met.
8. Once the for-loop is terminated, compare the player_wins and computer_wins variables to see who won the game. Print the outcome.
